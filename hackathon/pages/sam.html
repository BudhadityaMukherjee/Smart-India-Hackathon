                <p>
                    This scheme aims at setting up Samarth Centres for providing respite and residential care of the
                    specified categories of Persons with Disability (PwD). Samarth Centre should provide at a minimum
                    following facilities:</p>
                <p class="intro2">
                    <strong>Group Home</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    RO should provide group home facility for all age groups with adequate and quality care service with
                    acceptable living standards including provision of basic medical care from professional
                    doctors<em><strong>.</strong></em>Capacity of a Samarth Centre is 30 including non LIG and non BPL
                    PwDs.</p>
                <p>
                    Batch size of a Samarth centre is 30 PwDs and the maximum number of PwDs allowed is 30% extra of
                    batch size i.e. 39 for Samarth Centres. On reaching the maximum limit of 39 PwDs, Samarth centre
                    shall not allow anymore PwDs to enrol in the centre. ROs are encouraged to apply again if they have
                    sufficient number of PwDs for the new Samarth Centre.</p>
                <p>
                    RO should maintain a ratio of 1:1 for LIG (including BPL) and above LIG PwDs (which will be paid
                    seats for RO). Payment for the above LIG seats could be received by RO from parents, guardians,
                    family members, RO or any other institute/ individual directly as per mutually agreed terms and
                    conditions between RO and the other party involved (parents, guardians, family members, RO or any
                    other institute/ individual)</p>
                <p>
                    As stated earlier in the document, it is to be noted that RO should bring in more PwDs to the
                    Samarth centre who are either Non-LIGs or who are not covered in the above mentioned category, to
                    ensure sustainability.</p><br>

                    *Note that the set up cost has been increased from Rs. 1,95,000 to Rs.2,90,000 based on the
                    discussion </em><em>in the Conference of State Welfare Secretaries held in Delhi on 1

                    National Trust will provide funding to the Samarth Centre under following three heads:</p>
                <p>
                    <strong class="intro"> I. Setup Cost</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a non-recurring one-time cost that would be provided to RO initially to setup the Samarth
                    Centre. In addition to the grant from National Trust, RO is free to arrange grant from other sources
                    to improve the infrastructure. It shall be the prerogative of the RO to buy the necessary products
                    and items for set up from the places of their choice.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong class="intro">II. Sustenance Cost</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sustenance Cost shall be provided by the National Trust to Samarth Centre for maximum 3 months after
                    the set up period. This has been provisioned considering the fact that the RO would find it
                    difficult to enrol 30 PwDs in the first month. Sustenance cost shall be given in order to ensure
                    that all staff and facilities are available and functional from the first day of operation of the
                    centre, irrespective of the number of PwDs enrolled. The advantage of providing sustenance cost is
                    that the RO would be able to run the centre without any difficulty and also because the National
                    Trust believes that it would be able to become stable within the sustenance period.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong class="intro2">Qualification criteria for sustenance</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    National Trust shall provide sustenance cost to the centre only if the minimum number of PwDs in a
                    Samarth centre in initial 3 months is at least 20% of the expected batch size in each month ( in
                    this case 6). The centre can be made operational only when minimum 6 PwDs are enrolled.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong class="intro2">Calculation of sustenance</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sustenance Cost shall be calculated on pro-rata basis based on difference in total expected PwDs and
                    number of actual PwDs in the centre during the 3 months.<br />
                    <em>For example, If RO has 6 PwDs in the first month of its operation, then sustenance cost will
                        be</em> <em>paid for 30- 6 = 24 PwDs. However, for the 6 PwDs already enrolled, monthly
                        recurring cost</em> <em>shall be paid as per the scheme.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong class="intro2">Validity of sustenance</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The provision of sustenance cost is conditional upon the timely start of operation of the Samarth
                    centre. The Samarth centre is expected to start operations within 1 month from the release of set up
                    cost. In case the start of operations exceeds this deadline by more than a month (that means
                    operations have not started even within 2 months from release of setup cost), the overall period for
                    which sustenance cost would be provided would be reduced by the duration of delay. For example, if
                    the Samarth centre starts the operation three months after the set up cost has been provided,
                    sustenance cost shall only be provided for 2 months. Similarly, if the Samarth centre starts the
                    operation four months after the set up cost has been provided, sustenance cost shall only be
                    provided for 1 month.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong class="intro2">Samarth-Respite Care</strong><br />
                    In case the Samarth centre closes down within one year of start of operations, sustenance amount
                    that is given to concerned RO for the Samarth Centre shall be taken back from that RO.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The National Trust shall pay monthly recurring cost for all PwDs at Samarth Centre which are
                    eligible to be funded by the National Trust starting from first month of operations. The National
                    Trust shall fund the Centre only if the minimum number of PwD in a Samarth centre in the month is
                    30% of the expected batch size (i.e. in this case 9)</p>
                <p>
                    The National Trust shall fund the PwD as per the following conditions:</p>
                <p>
                    a. The National Trust shall fund PwDs in a Samarth Centre in 1:1 ratio provided there are equal
                    numbers of LIG (including BPL) and above LIG PwDs. LIG shall be defined as follows:</p>
                <p>
                    <em>LIG = BPL limit set by the state + additional 50% of BPL Limit of that state</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    b. If number of LIG (including BPL) PwDs is more than number of above LIG PwDs, funds shall be
                    provided for only those LIG for which 1:1 ratio is maintained ( LIG including BPL : Above LIG
                    category). In this scenario, BPLs shall be given preference for funding.</p>
                <p>
                    c. If number of LIG (including BPL) PwDs is less than number of above LIG PwDs, the National Trust
                    shall fund total number of LIG (including BPL).</p>
                <p>
                    d. Apart from this, the National Trust will fund 100% BPL PwDs in Samarth Centre as per the scheme
                    irrespective of ratio, but same is not true for LIGs</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>STEP 2. </strong>The application form is available online on the National Trust website and
                    has to be submitted online only. Application fees or enrolment in Samarth scheme is INR 1000/-
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>STEP 3. </strong>After the National Trust receives the application form and the documents,
                    these are verified and then physical verification is initiated. However, if there is any missing
                    information or wrongly submitted information which needs to be submitted again, the RO is given 15
                    days&rsquo; time to submit it again from the date of intimation of missing document by the National

                    all necessary formalities and processes. Based on the Physical verification report, if the RO meets
                    scheme criteria and requirements, the application is approved. In case there is any discrepancy, RO
                    is accordingly informed.

                <p>
                    <strong>STEP 5. </strong>Communication to RO by the National Trust shall be done within 15 days from
                    point of receipt. In case of online form, point of receipt is date and time of submission of online
                    form along with all the required documents. However, if there is any missing information, the
                    National Trust has to communicate to RO within 10 days from receipt of online submission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>STEP 6. </strong>In case the RO has not yet sent the hard copies of the documents, the
                    National Trust would send a communication to the RO within 15 days from the prescribed time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>STEP 7. </strong>Once Enrolment is completed, a scheme ID is created for the RO, and the
                    confirmation for the same is communicated to RO.
