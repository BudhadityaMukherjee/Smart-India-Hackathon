                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This scheme aims at setting up Vikaas Centres for welfare of PwDs. Registered Organization (RO)
                        should provide at a minimum following facilities in their Vikaas Centre:</p>
                    <p class="intro2">
                        <strong>Day Care</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        RO should provide day-care facilities to PwDs for at least 6 hours in a day (between 8 am to 6
                        pm)
                        along with age specific activities. Day care should be open for at least 21 days in a month.
                        Expected batch size of a Vikaas centre is 30 PwDs. The minimum attendance required for a PwD in
                        the
                        Vikaas centre is 15 days per month for National Trust to fund the PwD.</p>
                    <p>
                        Batch size of a Vikaas centre is 30 PwDs with a maximum number of PwDs allowed is 30% extra of
                        batch
                        size i.e. 39 for Vikaas Centres. On reaching the maximum limit of 39 PwDs, Vikaas centre shall
                        not
                        allow anymore PwDs to enrol in the centre. ROs are encouraged to apply again if they have
                        sufficient
                        number of PwDs for the new Vikaas Centre.</p>
                    <p>
                        RO should maintain a ratio of 1:1 for LIG (including BPL) and above LIG PwDs (which will be paid
                        seats for RO). Payment for the above LIG seats could be received by RO from parents, guardians,
                        family members, RO or any other institute/ individual directly as per mutual agreed terms and
                        conditions between RO and the other party involved (parents, guardians, family members, RO or
                        any
                        other institute/ individual)</p>
                    <p>
                        The ROs should also get in touch with paediatricians or experts in similar field to seek help in
                        getting more PwD enrolled in the Vikaas centre.</p>

                            the set up period. This has been provisioned considering the fact that the RO would find it
                            difficult to enrol 30 PwDs in the first month. Sustenance cost shall be given in order to
                            ensure
                            that all staff and facilities are available and functional from the first day of operation

                            the centre, irrespective of the number of PwDs enrolled. The advantage of providing
                            sustenance
                            cost is that the RO would be able to run the centre without any difficulty and also we
